# Kubernetes Dashboard

The Kubernetes dashboard is a web ui that lets you view, monitor, and troubleshoot Kubernetes resources. 

> Note: The Kubernetes dashboard is a secured endpoint and can only be accessed using the SSH keys for the cluster. Since cloud shell runs in the browser, it is not possible to tunnel to the dashboard using the steps below.

### Accessing The Dashboard UI

There are multiple ways of accessing Kubernetes dashboard. You can access through kubectl command-line interface or through the master server API. We'll be using kubectl, as it provides a secure connection, that doesn't expose the UI to the internet.

1. Command-Line Proxy

    * Install Azure CLI in your laptop/desktop. Once Installed, use ```az aks install-cli``` to install kubectl
    * Run ```az login``` to authenticate with Azure in order to use Azure CLI in the Jumpbox instead of Cloud Shell
    * Run ```NAME=$(az group list -o table | grep ODL | awk '{print $1}')``` in order to retrieve the name of the resource group for your Azure account and put it in the NAME variable.
    * Run ```CLUSTER_NAME="${NAME//_}"``` in order to retrieve the cluster name (to remove the underscore)
    * Run ```az aks get-credentials -n $CLUSTER_NAME -g $NAME``` in order to get the credentials to access our managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure
    * Run ```kubectl proxy```
    * This creates a local proxy to 127.0.0.1:8001
    * Open a web browser and point to: <http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/#!/cluster?namespace=default>
### Accessing The Dashboard UI with RBAC Enabled AKS Clusters

if your AKS Cluster is RBAC enabled, you might get erros such as 
```configmaps is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard" cannot list configmaps in the namespace "default"
close
warning
persistentvolumeclaims is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard" cannot list persistentvolumeclaims in the namespace "default"
```
![Error](https://pascalnaber.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/dashboard-errors.png?w=1024 "Fork the workshop Github repo")

If your AKS cluster uses RBAC, a ClusterRoleBinding must be created before you can correctly access the dashboard. By default, the Kubernetes dashboard is deployed with minimal read access and displays RBAC access errors. The Kubernetes dashboard does not currently support user-provided credentials to determine the level of access, rather it uses the roles granted to the service account. A cluster administrator can choose to grant additional access to the kubernetes-dashboard service account, however this can be a vector for privilege escalation. You can also integrate Azure Active Directory authentication to provide a more granular level of access.

To create a binding, use the kubectl create clusterrolebinding command as shown in the following example.

```kubectl create clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard```
### Explore Kubernetes Dashboard 

1. In the Kubernetes Dashboard select nodes to view nodes
2. Explore the different node properties available through the dashboard
3. Explore the different pod properties available through the dashboard ![](img/ui_pods.png)
4. In this lab feel free to take a look around other at  other resources Kubernetes provides through the dashboard

## Run an application

In the Kubernetes dashboard, click the **Create** button in the upper right window. Give the deployment the name `nginx` and enter `nginx:latest` for the container image name. Under **Service**, select **External** and enter `80` for both the port and target port.

When ready, click **Deploy** to create the deployment.

## View the application

Status about the application can be seen on the Kubernetes dashboard. Once the application is running, each component has a green checkbox next to it.

![Kubernetes Pods](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/raw/master/articles/aks//media/container-service-kubernetes-ui/complete-deployment.png)

To see more information about the application pods, click on **Pods** in the left-hand menu, and then select the **NGINX** pod. Here you can see pod-specific information such as resource consumption.

![Kubernetes Resources](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/raw/master/articles/aks//media/container-service-kubernetes-ui/running-pods.png)

To find the IP address of the application, click on **Services** in the left-hand menu, and then select the **NGINX** service.

## Edit the application

In addition to creating and viewing applications, the Kubernetes dashboard can be used to edit and update application deployments.

To edit a deployment, click **Deployments** in the left-hand menu, and then select the **NGINX** deployment. Finally, select **Edit** in the upper right-hand navigation bar.

![Kubernetes Edit](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/raw/master/articles/aks//media/container-service-kubernetes-ui/view-deployment.png)

Locate the `spec.replica` value, which should be 1, change this value to 3. In doing so, the replica count of the NGINX deployment is increased from 1 to 3.

Select **Update** when ready.
