    ```
    cd ~/AzureKubernetesService-Workshop/Azure-Voting-App

    vi azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
    ```
    * Review the yaml file and learn about some of the settings

2. Deploy applications to AzureAKS

* Use the kubectl CLI to deploy each app
    ```

    kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
    ```
3. Validate

* Check to see if pods are running in your cluster
    ```
    kubectl get pods
    
* Check to see if services are deployed.
    ```
    kubectl get service
    
Browse to the External IP for your web application (on port 8080) and try the app
