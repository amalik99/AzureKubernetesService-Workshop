# Running Stateful Application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Create persistent volumes with Azure disks for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

A persistent volume represents a piece of storage that has been provisioned for use with Kubernetes pods. A persistent volume can be used by one or many pods and can be dynamically or statically provisioned. 
> [!NOTE]
> An Azure disk can only be mounted with *Access mode* type *ReadWriteOnce*, which makes it available to only a single AKS node. If needing to share a persistent volume across multiple nodes, consider using Azure Files

## Built in storage classes

A storage class is used to define how a unit of storage is dynamically created with a persistent volume. For more information on Kubernetes storage classes, see [Kubernetes Storage Classes][kubernetes-storage-classes].

Each AKS cluster includes two pre-created storage classes, both configured to work with Azure disks:

* The *default* storage class provisions a standard Azure disk.
    * Standard storage is backed by HDDs, and delivers cost-effective storage while still being performant. Standard disks are ideal for a cost effective dev and test workload.
* The *managed-premium* storage class provisions a premium Azure disk.
    * Premium disks are backed by SSD-based high-performance, low-latency disk. Perfect for VMs running production workload. If the AKS nodes in your cluster use premium storage, select the *managed-premium* class.

Use the [kubectl get sc][kubectl-get] command to see the pre-created storage classes. The following example shows the pre-create storage classes available within an AKS cluster:

```
$ kubectl get sc

NAME                PROVISIONER                AGE
default (default)   kubernetes.io/azure-disk   1h
managed-premium     kubernetes.io/azure-disk   1h
```

> [!NOTE]
> Persistent volume claims are specified in GiB but Azure managed disks are billed by SKU for a specific size. These SKUs range from 32GiB for S4 or P4 disks to 4TiB for S50 or P50 disks. The throughput and IOPS performance of a Premium managed disk depends on the both the SKU and the instance size of the nodes in the AKS cluster. For more information, see [Pricing and Performance of Managed Disks][managed-disk-pricing-performance].

## Create a persistent volume claim

A persistent volume claim (PVC) is used to automatically provision storage based on a storage class. In this case, a PVC can use one of the pre-created storage classes to create a standard or premium Azure managed disk.

Create a file named `azure-premium.yaml`, and copy in the following manifest. The claim requests a disk named `azure-managed-disk` that is *5GB* in size with *ReadWriteOnce* access. The *managed-premium* storage class is specified as the storage class. This file is already available in your repo

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: azure-managed-disk
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: managed-premium
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

> [!TIP]
> To create a disk that uses standard storage, use `storageClassName: default` rather than *managed-premium*.

Create the persistent volume claim with the [kubectl create][kubectl-create] command and specify your *azure-premium.yaml* file:

```
$ kubectl create -f azure-premium.yaml

persistentvolumeclaim/azure-managed-disk created
```

## Use the persistent volume

Once the persistent volume claim has been created and the disk successfully provisioned, a pod can be created with access to the disk. The following manifest creates a basic NGINX pod that uses the persistent volume claim named *azure-managed-disk* to mount the Azure disk at the path `/mnt/azure`.

Create a file named `azure-pvc-disk.yaml`, and copy in the following manifest. This file is already available in your cloned repo

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/mnt/azure"
        name: volume
  volumes:
    - name: volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: azure-managed-disk
```

Create the pod with the [kubectl create][kubectl-create] command, as shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl create -f azure-pvc-disk.yaml

pod/mypod created
```

You now have a running pod with your Azure disk mounted in the `/mnt/azure` directory. This configuration can be seen when inspecting your pod via `kubectl describe pod mypod`, as shown in the following condensed example:

```
$ kubectl describe pod mypod
