# Ingress Controllers

This lab will show how to use Kubernetes ingress controllers to route traffic to our Heroes web application.

## Add Ingress Controller to an Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster

There are a number of ingress controllers available today. Here is a quick, but not exhaustive list for reference purposes:

* Nginx
* Traefik
* LinkerD
* Custom Ingress Controllers

For the purposes of this lab we will be using Nginx as our ingress controller. 

## Configure Helm

We will use Helm to install Nginx. [Helm][helm] is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers such as *APT* and *Yum*, Helm is used to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

## Create a service account

Before you can deploy Helm in an RBAC-enabled cluster, you need a service account and role binding for the Tiller service. For more information on securing Helm / Tiller in an RBAC enabled cluster, see [Tiller, Namespaces, and RBAC][tiller-rbac]. If your cluster is not RBAC enabled, skip this step.

Create a file named `helm-rbac.yaml` and copy in the following YAML: This file is already in Azure-Voting-App directory.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
```

Create the service account and role binding with the `kubectl create` command:

```console
kubectl create -f helm-rbac.yaml
```

## Configure Helm

To deploy a basic Tiller into an AKS cluster, use the [helm init][helm-init] command. If your cluster is not RBAC enabled, remove the `--service-account` argument and value. If you configured TLS/SSL for Tiller and Helm, skip this basic initialization step and instead provide the required `--tiller-tls-` as shown in the next example.

```console
helm init --service-account tiller
```

If you configured TLS/SSL between Helm and Tiller provide the `--tiller-tls-` parameters and names of your own certificates, as shown in the following example:

```console
helm init \
    --tiller-tls \
    --tiller-tls-cert tiller.cert.pem \
    --tiller-tls-key tiller.key.pem \
    --tiller-tls-verify \
    --tls-ca-cert ca.cert.pem \
    --service-account tiller
```

## Install Nginx using Helm

The Nginx Ingress Controller is an Ingress controller that uses a ConfigMap to store the nginx configuration and provides layer 7 capabilities for applications deployed on Kubernetes.

1. Install Nginx using Helm CLI

    ``` bash
    # The following command will install the Nginx ingress controller into the K8s cluster.

    helm install --name ingress stable/nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system
    ```

2. Validate that Nginx was installed
    
    ``` bash
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep nginx

    # You should see something like the following as output:
    ingress-nginx-ingress-controller-86bf69bcfc-jqvsg        1/1       Running   0          1d
    ingress-nginx-ingress-default-backend-86d6db4c47-td2k8   1/1       Running   0          1d
    ```

    * The nginx-ingress helm chart deploys a nginx ingress controller and also a backend for the ingress controller. The backend is used when a route is not found and will display a 404 error. You can browse to the public IP to preview this. 

    ``` bash
    kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep nginx

    # You should see something like the following as output:
    ingress-nginx-ingress-controller       LoadBalancer  10.0.231.143  52.173.190.190  80:30910/TCP,443:30480/TCP  1d
    ingress-nginx-ingress-default-backend  ClusterIP     10.0.175.123  <none>          80/TCP                      1d
    ```

    * The nginx controller will use a LoadBalancer type service where the backend is of type ClusterIP

## Deploy the Voting app with Ingress

We will now deploy the application with a configured Ingress resource.

1. Clear anything out of your cluster by deleting your deployments

    ```bash
    kubectl delete -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
    ```

2. Review `azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml` file for ingress configuration
 

    ``` bash
    vi azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml
    ```
    
        > Note: Below is an example of a Ingress object

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
    name: heroes-web-ingress
    annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        # Add to generate certificates for this ingress
        kubernetes.io/tls-acme: 'false'
    spec:
    rules:
        - host:
        http:
            paths:
            - backend:
                serviceName: web
                servicePort: 8080
                path: /
    ```



3. Depoy azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml 

    ``` bash
    kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml
    ```

    > Note: Below is an example of a Ingress object

    ```yaml
```
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: azure-vote-front-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    # Add to generate certificates for this ingress
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: 'false'
spec:
  rules:
  - host: IP.xip.io
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /
          backend:
            serviceName: azure-vote-front
            servicePort: 80
    ```
```
5. Browse to the web app via the Ingress

```
# get ingress external IP
kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep ingress

ingress-nginx-ingress-controller        LoadBalancer   10.0.155.205   52.186.29.245   80:32045/TCP,443:31794/TCP   2h
ingress-nginx-ingress-default-backend   ClusterIP      10.0.171.59    <none>          80/TCP                       2h
```
