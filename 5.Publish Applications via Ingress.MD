# Ingress Controllers

This lab will show how to use Kubernetes ingress controllers to route traffic to our Heroes web application.

## Add Ingress Controller to an Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster

There are a number of ingress controllers available today. Here is a quick, but not exhaustive list for reference purposes:

* Nginx
* Traefik
* LinkerD
* Custom Ingress Controllers

For the purposes of this lab we will be using Nginx as our ingress controller. 

## Configure Helm

We will use Helm to install Nginx. We had configured Helm in prior labs. 

1. Open the Azure Cloud Shell

2. Validate your Helm install by running the below commands.

    ``` bash
    helm version

    # You should see something like the following as output:
    Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.7.2", GitCommit:"8478fb4fc723885b155c924d1c8c410b7a9444e6", GitTreeState:"clean"}
    Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.7.2", GitCommit:"8478fb4fc723885b155c924d1c8c410b7a9444e6", GitTreeState:"clean"}
    ```

    > Note: If helm was not configured, you must run `helm init`

## Install Nginx using Helm

The Nginx Ingress Controller is an Ingress controller that uses a ConfigMap to store the nginx configuration and provides layer 7 capabilities for applications deployed on Kubernetes.

1. Install Nginx using Helm CLI

    ``` bash
    # The following command will install the Nginx ingress controller into the K8s cluster.

    helm install --name ingress stable/nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system
    ```

2. Validate that Nginx was installed
    
    ``` bash
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep nginx

    # You should see something like the following as output:
    ingress-nginx-ingress-controller-86bf69bcfc-jqvsg        1/1       Running   0          1d
    ingress-nginx-ingress-default-backend-86d6db4c47-td2k8   1/1       Running   0          1d
    ```

    * The nginx-ingress helm chart deploys a nginx ingress controller and also a backend for the ingress controller. The backend is used when a route is not found and will display a 404 error. You can browse to the public IP to preview this. 

    ``` bash
    kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep nginx

    # You should see something like the following as output:
    ingress-nginx-ingress-controller       LoadBalancer  10.0.231.143  52.173.190.190  80:30910/TCP,443:30480/TCP  1d
    ingress-nginx-ingress-default-backend  ClusterIP     10.0.175.123  <none>          80/TCP                      1d
    ```

    * The nginx controller will use a LoadBalancer type service where the backend is of type ClusterIP

## Deploy the Voting app with Ingress

We will now deploy the application with a configured Ingress resource.

1. Clear anything out of your cluster by deleting your deployments

    ```bash
    $ kubectl delete -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis.yaml
    ```

2. Review `azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml` file for ingress configuration
 

    ``` bash
    vi azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml
    ```
    
        > Note: Below is an example of a Ingress object

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
    name: heroes-web-ingress
    annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        # Add to generate certificates for this ingress
        kubernetes.io/tls-acme: 'false'
    spec:
    rules:
        - host:
        http:
            paths:
            - backend:
                serviceName: web
                servicePort: 8080
                path: /
    ```



3. Depoy azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml 

    ``` bash
    kubectl apply -f azure-vote-all-in-one-redis-ingress.yaml
    ```

    > Note: Below is an example of a Ingress object

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
    name: heroes-web-ingress
    annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
        # Add to generate certificates for this ingress
        kubernetes.io/tls-acme: 'false'
    spec:
    rules:
        - host:
        http:
            paths:
            - backend:
                serviceName: web
                servicePort: 8080
                path: /
    ```

5. Browse to the web app via the Ingress

```
# get ingress external IP
kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep ingress

ingress-nginx-ingress-controller        LoadBalancer   10.0.155.205   52.186.29.245   80:32045/TCP,443:31794/TCP   2h
ingress-nginx-ingress-default-backend   ClusterIP      10.0.171.59    <none>          80/TCP                       2h
```

* Using the external IP of the controller, go to http://52.186.29.245
